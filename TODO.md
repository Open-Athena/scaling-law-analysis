- Reduce decimal precision in figures where possible
- Expand on this:
  - > For surfaces with asymmetric exponents, wider sampling grids amplify the parabola-fitting mismatch, increasing the constant vertex shift and thus the intercept bias.
  - Mention that it affects extrapolation as well
- Rename "High Imbalance" to "Asymmetric"
- Replace references to scaling grid sizes with code blocks e.g. `Small` instead of "Small"
- Revisit this, which is not really correct:
  - > Asymmetric curve shapes: The IsoFLOP curves are visibly steeper on one side of the minimum than the other, consistent with alpha != beta. This is the condition under which the parabolic approximation introduces systematic intercept bias.
- Prior to final review:
  - Review figures.py for ways to use existing code utilities and then regen
