# Scaling Law Simulation

Simulation and analysis of Chinchilla scaling laws for neural network training.

## Overview

This project demonstrates flaws in Chinchilla Approach 2 for scaling law exponent inference and evaluates alternative methods.

## Installation

```bash
uv sync
```

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Empirical Error Analysis

Demonstrates how Approach 2 accuracy depends on grid step size.

```bash
uv run python experiments/experiment_1.py
```
