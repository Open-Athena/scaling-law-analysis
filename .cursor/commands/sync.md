# sync

Synchronize specs and outputs per [specs/sync.md](../../specs/sync.md). Skip build steps (use /build separately).

## Mode

- **`/sync`** or **`/sync changes`**: Sync only what is affected by changes in the working tree.
- **`/sync all`**: Review all spec ↔ output links regardless of local changes.

## Output

Summarize the mode used, what was reviewed, and any changes made.
